## About me:

During 2011-2013 I worked as a design engineer. My main task was to develop design documentation from scratch in a small but fast growing company. Under the pressure of time it was necessary to think over and implement the system of design documentation understandable for everyone. As a result I managed to establish contacts with all the departments of the company, collect all the necessary information, opinions of some other employees and to solve the problem.

In 2013 I moved to Belarus and from that time until 2019 I worked as a medical equipment engineer in the hospital of our city. My responsibilities included providing maintenance, repair and procurement of different medical equipment for the needs of the hospital. That job was new for me and I had to independently search for all the necessary information about various medical equipment (types, purpose, manufacturers, evaluation criteria). I also had to contact a large number of specialists from other departments and other organizations as well. As a matter of fact Procurement legislation is constantly changing. So it was necessary to adjust all the time and to change the work order according to the new conditions. I believe that thanks to working together with my coworkers I managed to successfully cope with my duties.

Despite the fact that my main job wasn't related to the IT sphere, I continued to be interested in this.

Since 2019 I've been on maternity leave and I've realized this is my chance for self-development, the opportunity to find my place in this multifaceted field. I've started studying English with a teacher, to learn the basics of web development, programming and databases on my own. But until now I've lacked a guide who would help me to find myself in IT and to move on.

 I really hope RSSchool courses will become such a guid fo me!
